LT-Gaussian is a novel map updating method for 3D-GS based maps (Gaussian-maps) in autonomous driving. It compares the Gaussian-maps of past moments with the current LiDAR data stream through the proposed structural change detection technique and Gaussian map updating technique, and performs targeted updating of the Gaussian maps to generate the latest maps.

The code will be released soon :smile:.
