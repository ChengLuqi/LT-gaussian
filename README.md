[LT-Gaussian: Long-Term Map Update Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving]

Luqi Cheng, Zhangshuo Qi, Zijie Zhou, Guangming Xiong*

LT-Gaussian is a novel map updating method for 3D-GS based maps (Gaussian-maps) in autonomous driving. It compares the Gaussian-maps of past moments with the current LiDAR data stream through the proposed structural change detection technique and Gaussian map updating technique, and performs targeted updating of the Gaussian maps to generate the latest maps.

We will release the code and relevant data upon the acceptance of our paper.
